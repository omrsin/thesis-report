\TUsection{Hypothesis}

%TODO: rephrase
This study aims to identify if \textit{symbolic execution techniques can be used in the context of big data frameworks to generate reduced input data sets that enforce path coverage}.

\TUsection{Research Questions}

The following research questions are relevant for this study:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is symbolic execution a suitable technique for analyzing programs in the context of Spark applications.
	\item What are the particular characteristics associated with the symbolic execution of a Spark program.
	\item Is there a symbolic execution framework that can be adapted to perform symbolic executions of Spark programs.
	\item If it exists, what are the advantages and disadvantages of such a framework in the context of Spark applications.	
\end{enumerate}
