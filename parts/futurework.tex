\TUchapter{Future Work}

Allow the analysis on objects not only on primitive types.

Give support to Scala

Give support to more Spark actions and transformations, although the ones supported already provide the basic idea for the rest of the strategies.

Write an annotation that would allow the analysis of only the indicated methods, interconnecting those that are consecutive.
