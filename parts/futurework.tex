\TUsection{Limitations}

The limited support to String symbolic operations. The lack of a solver that specializes on Strings makes it limited to supporting many big data tasks.

The complications when dealing with lambda expressions makes it difficult to use the tool on real spark applications. Because most current developers prefer java8 syntax favoring its flexibility and reduced verbosity.

The ugly ill-maintained codebase of jpf-symbc makes it cumbersome to extend and easily outdated due to abundance of code smells and bad practices.

Although support for other solvers is mentioned, in practice, many of them fail due to missing libraries which are outdated when independently included.

Limited support to objects and how symbolic objects are created and shared
