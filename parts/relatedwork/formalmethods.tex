(Model Checking, why should we use it?)

(Related to Model Checking --- First of all, programs often contain fatal errors despite the existence of careful designs.Many deadlocks and critical section violations, for example, are introduced at a level of detail which designs typically do not deal with, if formal designs are made at all.)

(Related to Model Checking --- The other kind of error is more simple minded concurrency programming errors, such as forgetting to put code in a critical section or causing deadlocks. Errors of this kind will typically not be caught in a design, and they are a real hazard, in particular in safety critical systems.)
