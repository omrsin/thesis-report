\label{ch:jpf-symspark}

JPF-SymSpark is a \jpf module whose goal is to coordinate the symbolic execution of Spark programs and produce a reduced input dataset that ensures full path coverage on a regular execution. It builds on top of \spf to delegate the handling symbolic expressions while it focus on how to interconnect Spark's transformations and actions in order to reason coherently over the program's data flow.

In the following sections we will provide an overview of the logical process carried out by the analysis and an explanation of the different components that conform the module.
